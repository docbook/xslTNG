It allows the wearer to hear thoughts and feelings of others; it can backfire if the ones the wearer is listening to have terrible secrets. The only known pendant on Earth was destroyed by Toshiko Sato in "Greeks Bearing Gifts". As Tosh pointed out, the only truthful thing Mary said about the pendant is that it can be too much for the wearer to handle.</p></section><section id="id_Amnesia_pill" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">3</span><span class="sep">. </span>Amnesia pill</h2></header><p>Amnesia pills to cause someone to forget recent memories. The amnesia can be cured if the person's memories are triggered by one specific image (and if they are intelligent enough). Jack used this on Gwen Cooper after she first learned about the Torchwood Hub. It contains a special compound known as <em>B67</em> or <em>Retcon</em> (in reference to retroactive continuity). The website reveals the pills were developed by Torchwood One under Yvonne Hartman, as well as several details about its effectiveness. 2 oz of B67 is only sufficient to cause mild confusion in young children (6–7), with 4 oz being able to cause memory loss in older persons (61–64), and 8 oz is sufficient to cause memory loss in people in their late 20s although in one instance, caused a stress-induced heart attack in a 64-year-old man. Gwen Cooper feeds Rhys retcon whilst confessing her affair with Owen, so that he will not remember. It is revealed in "End of Days" that those dismissed from Torchwood are "Retconned" within 24 hours. Other suggested names for the compound included <em>Goldfish</em> and <em>Scooter</em>.</p><p>Jack appears to have a supply of, or made, his own Retcon during the events of Season Four - "Miracle Day". He drugged Esther with it, only for it to prove pointless in the following episode where she is forced to join Torchwood, and someone from the Three Families that was spying on Gwen to see if she had any contact with Jack.</p></section><section id="id_The_Amok" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">4</span><span class="sep">. </span>The Amok</h2></header><p>The Amok is a multi-dimensional coin-shaped item which appears to be a recreational game for an alien race. As humans only operate within a four-dimensional world, the incomprehensible dimensions of the Amok cause surrounding humans to go mad with desire to take their turn playing. When in possession of the Amok, humans talk unintelligibly about things being "big <em>big</em> big" and witness blue lights behind their eyelids. The madness is so acute that humans can kill each other or themselves in an attempt to take their turn. When the Torchwood team encounter the Amok in the novel <em>Border Princes</em> by Dan Abnett, they are also affected by it, but eventually manage to contain it safely behind a physical firewall; it is subsequently destroyed in the same novel by Mr Dine.</p></section><section id="id_Anti-Cyberman_Special_Weapons" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">5</span><span class="sep">. </span>Anti-Cyberman Special Weapons</h2></header><p>Anti-Cyberman Special Weapons are special rifles designed and developed by scientists from the Parallel Torchwood to fight the Cybermen, and brought to Earth during the Cyberman Invasion, subsequently being retained by Torchwood in case the Cybermen ever return from the void. Torchwood Three has a supply of these weapons in the Weapons Room (which was sealed during the event caused by Cyberwoman Lisa Hallett, where cutting off the Hub's power supply caused the facility to go into lockdown and prevent access to the weapons). An aesthetically similar weapon, possibly an upgraded version, of the anti-cyber weaponry was seen and fired in the Doctor Who episode "A Nightmare in Silver."</p></section><section id="id_Anti-Droon_audio_paddle" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">6</span><span class="sep">. </span>Anti-Droon audio paddle</h2></header><p>A plastic paddle that, when held to the forehead of a Droon host, ejects the Droon forcibly through the nostril of the victim. The paddle is used in the <em>Torchwood</em> spin-off novel <em>Border Princes</em> by Dan Abnett.</p></section><section id="id_Antitoxin_Kit" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">7</span><span class="sep">. </span>Antitoxin Kit</h2></header><p>A piece of human-made technology created by Torchwood in response to numerous encounters with alien contagions and diseases. In "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", Owen Harper used one of the kits to save Gwen Cooper from death by Captain John Hart's lip-gloss toxin.</p></section><section id="id_Anti-Weevil_clamps" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">8</span><span class="sep">. </span>Anti-Weevil clamps</h2></header><p>A piece of metal tape that, when wound round a captive's ankles or wrists, then pressed together, would meld into an unbreakable loop, mimicking a pair of handcuffs. The loop can only be broken by irradiating it with low-level microwaves. Though called Anti-Weevil clamps, they can be used on people or other aliens.</p></section><section id="id_Anti-Weevil_spray" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">9</span><span class="sep">. </span>Anti-Weevil spray</h2></header><p>A spray that causes short term pain to Weevils, allowing them to be subdued in a similar manner to the use of pepper spray on humans. It is first seen in "Everything Changes". However, by "Combat", the Weevils appear to be gaining an immunity to it.</p></section><section id="id_Atom_accelerator" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">10</span><span class="sep">. </span>Atom accelerator</h2></header><p>An essential component of the Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS from "The Eleventh Hour" until "The Angels Take Manhattan". A similar-looking item can be seen in Torchwood's headquarters in "Day One", "Greeks Bearing Gifts" and "Random Shoes", all of which predate this prop's first appearance on <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p></section></section><section id="id_B" class="chapter component"><header><h2>Chapter <span class="label">3</span><span class="sep">. </span>B</h2></header><section id="id_Bekaran_deep-tissue_scanner" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">1</span><span class="sep">. </span>Bekaran deep-tissue scanner</h2></header><p>An X-ray device of alien-origin used by Owen in his medical analysis. It is capable of producing a photo-realistic X-ray on a tiny screen on the device, that can be viewed at any depth by adjusting the resolution. It appears in the novels <em>Another Life</em>, <em>Border Princes</em> and <em>Slow Decay</em>. It also appears in the radio play "Lost Souls".</p></section><section id="id_Binoculars" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">2</span><span class="sep">. </span>Binoculars</h2></header><p>Jack still has the futuristic binoculars that he used in the <em>Doctor Who</em> episode "The Empty Child".</p></section><section id="id_Black_Tile" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">3</span><span class="sep">. </span>Black Tile</h2></header><p>A piece of alien exotic technology that has been in Jack Harkness's possession since he joined Torchwood. Its function remains mostly unknown, but is assumed to be a form of early warning system. It was seen in <em>Border Princes</em>.</p></section><section id="id_Brudyac_psychic_receiver" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">4</span><span class="sep">. </span>Brudyac psychic receiver</h2></header><p>A small, spherical item, chrome in colour, inserted into the spine of any creature that the Brudyac wishes to control. It allows a Brudyac to take psychic control of the victim, with the only disadvantage being that it uses up the spinal fluid of the victim, requiring them to drink more. The device also injects the Brudyac's food source into the victim's stomach, where it grows. In the novel <em>Another Life</em> by Peter Anghelides, several characters have this device implanted into their spines, among them, Owen and Jack.</p></section></section><section id="id_C" class="chapter component"><header><h2>Chapter <span class="label">4</span><span class="sep">. </span>C</h2></header><section id="id_Compact_M1911" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">1</span><span class="sep">. </span>Compact M1911</h2></header><p>A .45 Caliber handgun used by everyone but Jack Harkness on the Torchwood team, the gun is a modern variant of the Colt Government M1911 model. It features a lightweight design while still packing a large amount of firepower.</p></section><section id="id_Contact_lenses" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">2</span><span class="sep">. </span>Contact lenses</h2></header><p>Special contact lenses which allow Torchwood headquarters to see everything the wearer sees. It also has special lip-reading technology to simulate hearing for the viewer, but only when lips are sufficiently visible. The wearer can receive instant messages from HQ. It was worn by Martha Jones in "Reset" to infiltrate the Pharm. In "Children of Earth", it was worn first by Lois Habiba to allow Torchwood to spy on negotiations between the British government and the 456 and then by Bridget Spears to gather information to force Prime Minister Brian Green out of office after his failures in handling the situation. It works by exploiting a solution to the EPR Paradox which is a supposed problem in the quantum theory relating to one of the three states of quantum particles, entanglement (See Quantum Physics). They are powered by body heat, so they only work when you wear them (Reset). Also, the contact lenses are untraceable by human technology (Reset and Children of Earth).</p><p>In <em>Children of Earth</em> (2009), Gwen, Rhys and Ianto share a moment of embarrassment after realising that they'd all used the Contact Lenses for "personal use". In <em>Miracle Day</em> (2011), they are given the name <strong class="bold">Eye-5</strong> lenses; Gwen says they are the only piece of Torchwood technology they managed to keep following the events of <em>Children of Earth</em>. In "Escape to L.A.", they were used in reverse; projecting an image of a PhiCorp executive's eye over Gwen's to spoof iris recognition. In "The Middle Men", Gwen uses them to record her blowing up a concentration camp in Wales; later, they are hacked into by Olivia Colasanto to tell Gwen that her family has been kidnapped and that she must deliver Jack. Rex subsequently uses them in "End of the Road" to record Brian Friedkin's confession.</p></section><section id="id_Cryo-chamber" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">3</span><span class="sep">. </span>Cryo-chamber</h2></header><p>Used by Torchwood to store corpses indefinitely. One of its uses is to provide corpses which can be disfigured and dumped to provide identifiable bodies for people who have been vapourised, eaten or otherwise destroyed by aliens ("Day One"). The source of the bodies is unclear. The body of Suzie Costello was seen being placed in storage at the end of "Everything Changes" and it has been used since on several occasions including when Jack is thought to be dead in "End of Days" and in "Exit Wounds".</p></section><section id="id_Cyber-conversion_unit" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">4</span><span class="sep">. </span>Cyber-conversion unit</h2></header><p>Scavenged by Ianto Jones from the ruins of Torchwood One and installed in the basement of the Hub.

The device later broke free, and started affecting people at random by melting their limbs together, revealing its true purpose as a weapon. Torchwood promptly launched "Operation Goldenrod" with the objective of stopping the device and repairing the damage. Owen Harper was charged with damage control and attempted to repair people's bodies through surgeries and medical techniques, but most of the victims never fully recovered due to scarring and disfigurement. The device also exhibited some sort of influence on its victims that drove them mad, forcing Sato to kill one in self-defense. This was her first kill, alien or otherwise, in the line of service for the Institute. Jack Harkness eventually found a way to destroy the device, but it caused a more violent side of his nature to surface, severely affecting the team's view of him. The remnants of the device and associated materials of Operation Goldenrod were then moved back to the Hub and stored in a specially lined chamber inside the facility. Goldenrod has been periodically mentioned throughout the series' first three novels, but its true nature was not revealed until <em>Slow Decay</em>.</p></section></section><section id="id_H" class="chapter component"><header><h2>Chapter <span class="label">9</span><span class="sep">. </span>H</h2></header><section id="id_HD_CCTV" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">1</span><span class="sep">. </span>HD CCTV</h2></header><p>First seen in "Day One", the scanner uses alien technology to convert a raster CCTV image into a smooth vector image, which can then be magnified in order to identify face shapes.</p></section><section id="id_Hologram_Projectors" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">2</span><span class="sep">. </span>Hologram Projectors</h2></header><p>Light emitters that form an illusionary environment around the viewer.

The glove fell through the rift <em>circa</em> 1967 and rested on the bottom of Cardiff Bay until Torchwood Three dredged it in early 2007. It has a strange but unspecified connection to a knife made of the same metal. The Torchwood Institute website details the testing of the glove, and that Suzie was buying goldfish in bulk and killing them to test the Glove. Suzie's research showed that the glove was slightly radioactive and that the glove possesses "low psych levels" which allows it to directly respond to brain activity. It was later established it has an empathic link with its wearer, like "a rope from [the] heart to the glove" and that transfers the life force of the wearer to keep the dead alive. The Glove is more effective on recent, violent trauma victims, prompting Suzie Costello to murder several Cardiff residents in order to improve her proficiency in using it. Following Suzie's suicide, the Glove is placed in Jack's safe and sealed with a "NOT FOR USE" tag.</p><p>In "They Keep Killing Suzie", it is used to bring Suzie back to life. Jack reveals that the glove was recovered from Cardiff Bay 40 years prior, and theorises that whoever owned it wanted to be rid of it.  Gwen is the only one with the degree of empathy required to operate the glove without Suzie.  When the glove was used on Suzie by Gwen it worked the same way as before, keeping her alive for the allotted amount of time however, when Gwen felt her begin to slip away she tried to forcefully bring her back and succeeded... but at a price.  Gwen's forced attempt to keep Suzie alive established a non-physical connection between the two with Suzie slowly draining Gwen's life force, healing Suzie and killing Gwen. Gwen gradually developed the same wound as Suzie, in the same place (i.e. gunshot wound in the back of the head) and this would have caused Gwen's death if the Glove was not destroyed in time (which Tosh did by shooting it), thereby reviving Gwen and killing Suzie. Again. However, Ianto points out that "gloves come in pairs", implying that there may be another glove.</p><p>The second glove appears in the episode "Dead Man Walking", in which it is retrieved from St. Mary's church where the Weevils had established a colony. It is used to revive Owen Harper, who had died from a gunshot wound in the previous episode. This glove appears to have the same powers, except Jack can use it, implying that the glove works best on those the wearer is emotionally involved with. The power that brings Owen back to life however seems to imbue the glove with a mind of its own and during an attempt to embalm Owen, the glove attacks the team; mainly Martha Jones, who is aged by the assault. The second glove was destroyed by a gunshot from Owen (just as the first one was by Tosh) and was not seen or mentioned after that in the episode. While the first Glove existed, Suzie could not be killed just as Owen could not. However, she showed the ability to heal – rapidly – and after her Glove was destroyed she died. Owen, however, never healed after resuscitation and continued to live after his Glove was destroyed.</p><p>Before the Glove was used on Owen, it had been discovered many centuries ago (around the time of the black plague) in Wales by a priest, who attempted to use it on a little girl called Faith.</p><p>Notably, Rassilon wears a similar-looking glove in "The End of Time", using it as a lethal weapon.</p></section><section id="id_Retcon" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">3</span><span class="sep">. </span>Retcon</h2></header><p>Retroactive continuity—<em>see Amnesia pill</em>

With the use of very precise co-ordinates and algebra, it can be used safely to negotiate minor time travel, but it is incredibly dangerous. Improper usage could cause "fractures in time" with apocalyptic results and due to a "preshock" of the "End of Days" events it has many precautions surrounding its usage, including retinal scans of all Torchwood staff in order to facilitate a full opening of the Rift. It should also be noted that the main part of the manipulator is very similar to the central column of the TARDIS console.

It is stored in a transparent case filled with a preservative liquid. Jack is very protective of the hand, saying that it means something only to him. In "End of Days", the hand glows when the TARDIS is nearby. In the Doctor Who episode, "Utopia", where Jack refers to the hand as a "Doctor detector", the hand is stolen by the Master. The hand is subsequently recovered by the Doctor.

Just as the ghosts are dispatched the "Ghostmaker" throws the open silver flask and, despite Ianto's quick catch, most of the human souls are lost in the air, so the affected victims of Cardiff die, all except for one child. The silver flask ends up being stored by Jack in his safe at Torchwood.</p></section><section id="id_Singularity_Scalpel" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">3</span><span class="sep">. </span>Singularity Scalpel</h2></header><p>In the episode "Reset", Jack cautions Owen in using this alien artifact. The item concentrates energy on an object without damaging anything on the way, for example a piece of paper within a plastic cup. At first, most of Owen's attempts to master the device were unsuccessful, but he manages to save Martha Jones by vapourising the alien mayfly within her at the episode's conclusion. It is later used by Rhys in "Something Borrowed", by which he successfully removes the alien baby from within Gwen's womb. In the series two alternate reality game on BBC Torchwood, an online singularity scalpel game features as part of a mission which involves scanning a body.  It also appears in Risk Assement.</p></section><section id="id_Sonic_Screwdriver" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">4</span><span class="sep">. </span>Sonic Screwdriver</h2></header><p>Captain Jack is seen using what resembles the Doctor's sonic screwdriver without the noise in the episode "Day One".</p></section><section id="id_Species_Database" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">5</span><span class="sep">. </span>Species Database</h2></header><p>Torchwood Three's main database on encountered or catalogued alien species.

The vehicle has a white-on-black non-standard typeface for the registration plate, usually found only on military vehicles and vehicles from before 1973 on British car number plates, and its registration number, CF06 FDU (indicating the vehicle was registered in Cardiff between March and September 2006), does not appear in the DVLA vehicle register ("Everything Changes"). It contains computers that can connect to the Torchwood Hub and to various databases, including those operated by the police. One such database, featured in the novel <em>Slow Decay</em>, allows Torchwood to change the traffic lights so that they are on green before they reach them. Although the vehicle is routinely referred to as an SUV, this is not a common designation in British English.</p><p>The SUV was stolen during the events of Children of Earth by bullies.</p><p>The SUV was also stolen in "Countrycide" Episode 6.
</p><p>During an auction of <em>Torchwood</em> and <em>Doctor Who</em> props, the SUV was sold for £18,000.

It is seen in the Doctor Who episode "Journey's End" when a Dalek attempts to gain entrance, activated when the Dalek is fired upon by Gwen Cooper and Ianto Jones. The Dalek is immediately frozen in time. Anything that threatens to break the lock is automatically caught in it.  However, during the Other Doctor's genocide of the Daleks, the force of the trapped Dalek's explosion broke the Time Lock, destroying it beyond repair.</p><p>As a result, during the events of "Children of Earth" the time lock failed to protect the Hub from destruction.</p></section><section id="id_Time_Agent_Wrist-Strap" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">6</span><span class="sep">. </span>Time Agent Wrist-Strap</h2></header><p>A 51st Century multi-purpose wrist-mounted device worn and operated by Jack Harkness. The range and limits of the device are unknown, though it is known it can function as a remote control, a short-distance communication device (including a built-in holographic projector which also allows voicemail) and a personal teleporter. It also had a Vortex Manipulator built-in to allow time travel (though jumping approximately 198,231 years caused it to burn out). At the end of "Last of the Time Lords" The Doctor disables Jack's Vortex Manipulator but left the device's other functions intact. Jack's former colleagues, including Captain John Hart also carry Time Agent Wrist-Straps. Jack got his wrist-strap to work as a teleporter again in the <em>Doctor Who</em> episode "The Stolen Earth", only for the Doctor to deactivate it once more in "Journey's End". It is revealed in "Children of Earth" that the wriststrap is practically indestructible, having survived an explosion that destroyed the Torchwood Hub. In "Rendition" it is also shown to warn of any current health issues of the wearer, at least warning of a low sodium content with an annoying beeping.</p></section><section id="id_Torchwood_server" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">7</span><span class="sep">. </span>Torchwood server</h2></header><p>A computer-control mechanism that regulates all computer use for Torchwood personnel. These appear to be far superior to public servers as Toshiko Sato mentioned in the novel <em>Another Life</em> that Owen Harper's new game "Second Reality" could only be played when the game was logged through the Hub's server; this implies that Torchwood's special servers can prevent back-tracing of any kind and protect private information.</p></section><section id="id_Torchwood_Stun_Gun" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">8</span><span class="sep">. </span>Torchwood Stun Gun</h2></header><p>The Torchwood team possess a specially designed stun gun engineered for use on humans and aliens alike.

In the future, it is used for buying items from shops, and used much like a scanner in today's supermarkets. In the present day, it can interfere with different objects depending on its setting. It can open car windows, turn traffic lights red, shut down servers, etc. It makes a different noise, much like a toy gun, depending on what setting it is on.</p></section></section><section id="id_V" class="chapter component"><header><h2>Chapter <span class="label">20</span><span class="sep">. </span>V</h2></header><section id="id_Virtual_reality_helmets" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">1</span><span class="sep">. </span>Virtual reality helmets</h2></header><p>These are interface devices capable of digital entry into a computer system.

The device is effective over distances in excess of several hundred miles, having been used to transport three people from London to a flying aircraft carrier over international waters roughly 700 miles away in <em>Doctor Who</em> episode "The Sound of Drums" (2007). However, its teleportation capabilities were disabled. In the <em>Doctor Who</em>/<em>Torchwood</em> crossover "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End" (2008), the device's teleportation facility was unlocked and subsequently disabled once again. It survives the explosion of the Hub in <em>Children of Earth</em> (2009) and remains in Jack's possession in <em>Miracle Day</em>. As of "The Day of the Doctor", however, it has been in UNIT's possession since one of Jack's deaths. Clara Oswald obtains the device and, provided with the activation code by the Eleventh Doctor, uses it to reunite with the Doctor in Elizabethan England. In "The Witch's Familiar", the female incarnation of the Master known as Missy also utilizes vortex manipulators while traveling with Clara Oswald, but they are burned out. In "Revolution of the Daleks," Jack is shown to have somehow reacquired his vortex manipulator and repaired the teleport function. Jack uses his vortex manipulator to break the Thirteenth Doctor out of prison and to board and destroy a Dalek ship. Vortex manipulators are also a device favored by River Song as a form of time travel in her younger years, although, as seen in "The Husbands of River Song," she later switches to stealing the Doctor's TARDIS instead.</p></section></section><section id="id_W" class="chapter component"><header><h2>Chapter <span class="label">21</span><span class="sep">. </span>W</h2></header><section id="id_Webley_Mk._IV.2C_.38.2F200_calibre_Revolver" class="section"><header><h2><span class="label">1</span><span class="sep">. </span>Webley Mk.
