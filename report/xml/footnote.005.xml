<title>Unit test: footnote.005</title>

<para>Papers
typically start on an odd-numbered, right-hand page: this could just follow from
right-hand pages being the ‘front’ of a leaf, or it could be a by-product of
single-article reprints of papers needing to start on a right-hand page.<footnote>
<para>Magazines and newspapers start articles as a two-page spread when it suits them, but in my limited experience, papers in journals and in conference proceedings do not start with a two-page spread.</para>
</footnote> Graphics are typically floated to the top
(and sometimes also to the bottom) of the page. In a two-column paper, graphics can be
either one column wide or span both columns. Large graphics might instead be grouped at
the back of the paper, after the references. The combination of a two-column layout plus
floating figures generally takes fewer pages than if all text, headings, and figures
span the width of the page.</para>
