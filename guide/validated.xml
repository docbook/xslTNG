<para>These stylesheets are the third
iteration of stylesheets for DocBook that I’ve written. I started working on the
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets">XSLT 1.0
Stylesheets for DocBook</link> in the 90’s, before XSLT 1.0 was
even a W3C Recommendation. I started working on the
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-stylesheets">XSLT 2.0
Stylesheets for DocBook</link> just around the time when XSLT 2.0 became
a W3C Recommendation. I wrote most of
<citetitle>DocBook xslTNG</citetitle> just a month or so before the third anniversary
of the XSLT 3.0 Recommendation.</para>

<para>Why did it take so long?</para>

  <para>To answer that question, we need to reflect for a moment on XSLT and
    its place in the XML ecosystem. When XSLT arrived on the scene, we
    were near the peak of XML enthusiasm. Not only was XML supported
    everywhere, it was possible to imagine XSLT everywhere as well.
    Certainly, the presence of XSLT in the browser felt significant at
    the time.
  </para>
  <para>The ubiquity of XML and the fact that XSLT was “just an XML
    vocabulary” may have contributed to another significant phenomenon:
    lots of users who did not self identify as programmers were learning
    to use XSLT and doing significant things with it.
  </para>
  <para>There were other tools available for transforming markup at the
    time, and arguably some of them were better than XSLT, but they were
    programming languages and you had to be a programmer to use them.
    They were also mostly commercial applications not widely available
    to casual users.
  </para>
  <para>XSLT was free, it was everywhere, and it was used by everyone, not
    “just” programmers. It was the clear winner than and remains the
    clear winner today in terms of markup transformation.
  </para>
  <para>You could do a lot of things with <xref linkend="XSLT10"/>. You could do a lot more
    things than you might at first even have thought possible. (In fact,
    you could do all things, but the
    Turing complete nature of XSLT isn’t relevant here.) Some very
    common tasks, like grouping, were possible but difficult. Lots of
    very useful things were either not possible or required extensions:
    regular expressions, functions, date and time formatting, creating
    special characters in the output, to name just a few.
  </para>
  <para><xref linkend="XSLT20"/> solved all of these problems (and more). Significantly, I
    think, all of these new features appealed directly to almost all
    users of XSLT 1.0. Everyone had encountered a grouping problem
    (building an index, for example). Everyone had wanted regular
    expression matching or date formatting. Lots of users wanted to
    write more sophisticated predicates (and many were willing to learn
    how to use functions to achieve that result).
  </para>
  <para><xref linkend="XSLT30"/> arguably introduces larger and
  more dramatic features than XSLT 2.0 did. There are a bunch of new
  features designed to enable streaming processing; there are
  significant software engineering improvements: packaging, exception
  handling, and assertions; there are common programming language
  constructs like maps and arrays. There is also a selection of
  features inherited from updates to XPath (new functions, a subset of
  <code>let</code> syntax, and support for higher order
  functions, for example).
  </para>
  <para>What’s curious, I think, is that many of these features are probably
    less immediately appealing to many (most?) current users. XSLT 2.0
    doesn’t feel constraining in the same way that XSLT 1.0 did, and the
    features in XSLT 3.0 don’t immediately and obviously solve problems
    that most users have.
  </para>
  <para>Streaming, for example, is incredibly powerful and it’s an important
    and significant milestone in markup processing. It makes it possible
    to solve whole classes of problems that were previously impossible
    to solve or required enormously expensive hardware. But my laptop
    will quite easily process a book full of complex markup that runs to
    hundreds of pages. I don’t have any problems that require a
    streaming processor.
  </para>
  <para>Likewise, packaging is useful and important. The <emphasis>DocBook
    xslTNG</emphasis> stylesheets should absolutely be a package. But
    that’s not true of a lot of stylesheets. There might be software
    engineering benefit in making a package even for stylesheets that
    you don’t intend to distribute, but that’s more likely to appeal to
    people who think of what they’re doing is programming.
  </para>
  <para>Nevertheless, there are lots of good reasons to use XSLT 3.0 even if
    you are “only” transforming documents and even if you don’t think of
    writing transformations as programming.
  </para>

  <title>Getting the stylesheets</title>
</info>

<para>There are three ways to get the stylesheets: you can
<link linkend="get-github">download the latest release</link> from
GitHub, you can <link linkend="get-maven">get them from Maven</link>,
or you can clone
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/docbook/xslTNG">the repository</link>
and  <link linkend="building">build them yourself</link>. We’ll cover
the first two options in this chapter; <xref linkend="building"/> covers
the last option in detail.</para>

<section xml:id="get-github">
<title>Download the latest release</title>

<para>The latest release is always available from the
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/docbook/xslTNG/releases">GitHub
releases page</link>. At the time of publication, the latest release was
version <?DocBook-xslTNG-version?>.</para>

<para>Distributed this way, you’ll get a ZIP file that contains the stylesheets
plus a number of ancillary files and tools. These are mostly covered in
the next chapter <xref linkend="using"/>.</para>

<para>You can unzip the file anywhere that’s convenient: in your home
directory or in a system-wide location.</para>

</section>

<section xml:id="get-maven">
<title>Getting the release from Maven</title>

<para>The latest release is always available
<link xlink:href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=org.docbook.docbook-xslTNG">from
Maven</link><footnote><para>With the caveat that it sometimes takes a few
hours for the releases to make their way from the registry onto the website.
If you’re chasing the very latest release and it’s just been published, it
may be available before it appears on the website.</para></footnote>.
</para>

<para>The group, artifact, and version ID for the latest release at
the time of publication is:</para>

<para role="center"><code>org.docbook:docbook-xslTNG:<?DocBook-xslTNG-version?></code></para>

<para>If you’re comfortable using Maven, I’m going to assume that’s all you
need to know.</para>

<para>The Maven distribution differs from the zip file in a couple of ways:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>It doesn’t bundle any of the dependencies. The
<link linkend="get-github">ZIP file</link> is more akin
to
<link xlink:href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947037/what-is-an-uber-jar">an
“uber” or “fat” jar</link>; it includes (some of) the core dependencies so
that it works out-of-the-box. Maven is designed to resolve dependencies,
so that shouldn’t be necessary here.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The Maven jar doesn’t include the Python script or the extra resources
(CSS and JavaScript files) because it doesn’t seem like it would be convenient
to extract them from the Maven jar (which will probably be installed deep in
some repository hierarchy well out of sight). Consequently, you may want to
<link linkend="get-github">download the distribution</link> periodically as well.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

</section>
</chapter> <!-- getting -->
<chapter version="5.0" xml:id="using">
<info>
  <?db filename="ch02.html"?>
  <title>Using the stylesheets</title>
</info>

<para>In principle, the stylesheets will run with any conformant XSLT
3.0 processor. For many users, that means
<link xlink:href="http://saxonica.com/">Saxon</link>. Although earlier versions
may work, Saxon 10.1 or later is recommended.</para>

<para>In principle, the instructions for using the stylesheets are
straightforward: using your XSLT 3.0 processor of choice, transform your
DocBook source documents with the <filename>docbook.xsl</filename>
stylesheet in the <filename class="directory">xslt</filename>
directory of the distribution.</para>

<para>In practice, for most users, running the stylesheets will
require getting a Java environment configured appropriately. For many,
one of the most significant challenges is getting all of the
dependencies sorted out. Modern software development, for better or
worse, often consists of one library relying on another which relies
on another, etc.</para>

<para>The <citetitle>DocBook xslTNG</citetitle> stylesheets attempt to
simplify this process, especially for the “out of the box” experience
by providing two convenience methods for running the stylesheets: a
jar file with a <classname>Main</classname> class, and a Python script
that attempts, among other things, to make sure all of the
dependencies are available.</para>

<para>If you’re an experience Java user, you may prefer to simply run
the stylesheets
<link linkend="run-with-java">directly with Java</link>.</para>

<para>Irrespective of which method you choose, running the stylesheets
is simply a matter of processing your input document
<quote><replaceable>myfile.xml</replaceable></quote> with
<quote><filename>xslt/docbook.xsl</filename></quote>. For example:
</para>

<screen role="monochrome border">$ <userinput>saxon myfile.xml -xsl:xslt/docbook.xsl -o:myfile.html</userinput>
</screen>

<para>The exact path to <filename>docbook.xsl</filename> will vary, of course,
but it’s in the <filename class="directory">xslt</filename> directory of the
distribution.</para>

<note>
<para>The resulting HTML document contains references to CSS stylesheets
and possibly JavaScript libraries. The output won’t look as nice in your browser
if those resources aren’t available. They’re in the <filename class="directory">resources</filename> directory of the distribution. A quick and easy way to see the
results is simply to send the output to the <filename class="directory">samples</filename>
directory from the distribution. The resources have already been copied into
that directory. In the longer run, you’ll want to make sure that they get
copied into the output directory for each of your projects.</para>
<para>Alternatively, you can copy them to a web location of your choosing and
point to them there. You can even point to them in
<link xlink:href="https://cdn.docbook.org/release/xsltng/current/resources">the
DocBook CDN</link>, but beware that those are not immutable. The “current”
version will change with every release and versioned releases will not persist
indefinitely.</para>
<para>Change the <parameter>resource-base-uri</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>resource-base-uri</secondary></indexterm> to adjust the paths
used in the output document.</para>
</note>

<para>Many aspects of the transformation can be controlled simply by
setting parameters (see <link linkend="params"/>). It’s also possible
to change the transformation by writing your own customization layer
(see <link linkend="customization"/>).</para>

<section xml:id="java-main">
<title>Using the Jar</title>

<para>The <link linkend="get-github">ZIP distribution</link> includes a
JAR file that you can run directly. That
JAR file is
<filename><replaceable>$ROOT</replaceable>/libs/docbook-xslTNG-<replaceable>version</replaceable>.jar</filename>
where “<code><replaceable>$ROOT</replaceable></code>” is whatever directory you chose
to unzip the distribution into and <replaceable>version</replaceable> is the
stylesheet version.</para>

<para>Assuming you unzipped the version <?DocBook-xslTNG-version?> distribution into
<filename class="directory">/home/ndw/xsltng</filename>, you can run
the JAR like this:</para>

<para><code>java -jar /home/ndw/xsltng/libs/docbook-xslTNG-<?DocBook-xslTNG-version?>.jar</code></para>

<para>Let’s try it out. Open a shell window and change to the samples directory,
<filename class="directory">/home/ndw/xsltng/samples</filename> assuming you unzipped
it as described above. Now run the java command:</para>

<screen role="monochrome border">$ <userinput>java -jar ../libs/docbook-xslTNG-<?DocBook-xslTNG-version?>.jar article.xml</userinput>
<computeroutput>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
…more HTML here...
&lt;nav class="bottom"&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</computeroutput></screen>

<para>That big splash of HTML was your first DocBook document
formatted by the stylesheets! Slightly more usefully, you can save
that HTML in a file:
</para>

<screen role="monochrome border">$ <userinput>java -jar ../libs/docbook-xslTNG-<?DocBook-xslTNG-version?>.jar article.xml \
        -o:article.html</userinput></screen>

<para>If you now open <filename>article.html</filename> in your
favorite web browser, you’ll see the transformed sample document
which should look like <xref linkend="fig-sample"/>.
</para>

<figure xml:id="fig-sample">
<title>The sample document: article.xml</title>
<mediaobject>
<alt>A rendering of the sample document</alt>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="media/sample.png" width="5.0in"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<para>This is a rendering of the sample document. It consists of the
title “Sample Article” centered on the screen with a short paragraph
of text below it. The text reads: This is a very simple DocBook
document. It serves as a kind of "smoke test" to demonstrate that the
stylesheets are working.
</para>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para xml:id="caveats">The JAR file, run this way, accepts the same
<link xlink:href="https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/using-xsl/commandline/">command line options</link> as Saxon, with a few caveats:</para>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</section>

<section xml:id="python-script">
<title>Using the Python script</title>

<para>The <link linkend="get-github">ZIP distribution</link> includes a
Python script in the <filename class="directory">bin</filename> directory.
This helper script is a convenience wrapper around Saxon. It sets up
the Java classpath and automatically configures a catalog resolver and
the DocBook extension functions.</para>

<important>
<para>The script requires the <application>click</application> and
<application>pygments</application> packages,
which you must install with <application>pip</application> before
running the script. For example:</para>
<programlisting linenumbering="unnumbered">python3 -m pip install pygments=2.6.1 click</programlisting>
</important>

<para>This script behaves much like the JAR file described in
<xref linkend="java-main"/>. In particular,
it accepts the same
<link xlink:href="https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/using-xsl/commandline/">command line options</link> as Saxon, with
<link linkend="caveats">the same caveats</link>.</para>

<para>The significant feature of the Python script is that it will
attempt to sort out the dependencies for you. It assumes that you’ve
used Maven to install the package and its dependencies, so you’ll
have to have <link xlink:href="http://maven.apache.org/">installed
Maven</link>. How you do that varies by platform, but your package
manager probably has it.</para>

<para>The following command will assure that you’ve downloaded all of
the necessary dependencies. You only have to do this once.</para>

<screen role="monochrome border">$ <userinput>mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.4:get \
      -Dartifact=org.docbook:docbook-xslTNG:<?DocBook-xslTNG-version?></userinput></screen>

<para>That might take a while.</para>

<para>The script will work through the dependencies that you have
installed, and the things that they depend on, and construct a Java
class path that includes them all.</para>

<para>The script stores its configuration in
<code>.docbook-xsltng.json</code> in your home directory.</para>

<para>Options passed to the script are processed as follows: the
initial options, all introduced by two hyphens, are interpreted by
this script; all the remaining options are passed directly to
Saxon.</para>

<para>The script options are:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><option>--help</option></term>
<listitem>
<para>Prints a usage message.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><option>--config:<replaceable>filename</replaceable></option></term>
<listitem>

<section xml:id="run-with-docker">
<title>Run with Docker</title>

<para>This is experimental.</para>

<para>The <filename class="directory">docker</filename> directory
contains an experimental Dockerfile. Using docker allows you to
isolate the environment necessary to run the <citetitle>DocBook xslTNG
Stylesheets</citetitle> from your local environment.</para>

<para>Using Docker is a three step process. Step 0, you have to have
installed Docker!</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Build the docker image. In the <filename class="directory">docker</filename> directory, run the docker build
command:</para>

<screen role="monochrome border">$ <userinput>docker build -t docbook-xslt .</userinput></screen>

<para>The “<option>-t</option>” option provides a tag for the image;
you can make this anything you want. There’s a <code>VERSION</code>
build argument if you want to build a particular release. For example,</para>

<screen role="monochrome border">$ <userinput>docker build --build-arg VERSION=0.9.14 -t docbook-xslt .</userinput></screen>

<para>will build a Docker image for the 0.9.14 release of the
stylesheets irrespective of the version in the Dockerfile.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Run the image, for example:</para>

<screen role="monochrome border">$ <userinput>docker run docbook-xsltng samples/article.xml</userinput></screen>

<para>If you chose a different tag when you built the image, use that
tag in place of <quote><code>docbook-xsltng</code></quote> in the <command>run</command>
command. Everything after the container tag becomes options to the
<link linkend="python-script"><command>docbook</command> Python script</link>.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<note>
<para>The context the script runs in is <emphasis>inside</emphasis>
the container. It can’t for example, see your local filesystem. The
example above works because the distribution is unpacked inside the
container. So the <filename>article.xml</filename> document isn’t the
one on your local filesystem.</para>
</note>

<para>You can use the Docker facilities for mounting directories to
change what documents the script can access. For example:
</para>

<screen role="monochrome border">$ <userinput>docker run -v /tmp:/output -v /path/to/samples:/input \
       docbook-xsltng /input/article.xml chunk=index.html \
       chunk-output-base-uri=/output/</userinput></screen>

<para>Assuming that the “samples” directory in the distribution is
located at <filename class="directory">/path/to/samples</filename>, this will chunk the
<filename>article.xml</filename> sample document that the script sees
in <filename class="directory">/input</filename>
(which is where you mounted samples) and it will write the
output to <filename class="directory">/output</filename> (which is where you mounted
<filename class="directory">/tmp</filename>).</para>

<para>When the script finishes, the chunked output will be in
<filename class="directory">/tmp</filename>.</para>

<tip>
<para>If you choose to use Docker, you don’t have to rebuild the container
everytime a new stylesheet release occurs. You can simply mount the new
<filename class="directory">xslt</filename> directory into the container
like any other directory.</para>
</tip>
</section>

<section xml:id="chunking">
<title>“Chunked” output</title>

<para>Transforming <quote><filename>myfile.xml</filename></quote> with
<filename>docbook.xsl</filename> usually produces a single HTML
document. For large documents, books like this one for example, it’s
sometimes desirable to break the input document into a collection of
web pages. You can achieve this with the
<citetitle>DocBook xslTNG Stylesheets</citetitle> by setting
two parameters:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><parameter>chunk</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk</secondary></indexterm></term>
<listitem>
<para>This parameter should be set to the name that you want to use for the
first, or top, page of the result. The name
<quote><filename>index.html</filename></quote> is a common choice.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><parameter>chunk-output-base-uri</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk-output-base-uri</secondary></indexterm></term>
<listitem>
<para>This parameter should be set to the absolute path where you want
to use as the base URI for the result documents, for example
<filename class="directory">/home/ndw/output/guide/</filename>.</para>
<note>
<para>The trailing slash is important, this is a URI. If you specify
only <filename class="directory">/home/ndw/output/guide</filename>, the
base URI will be taken to be <filename class="directory">/home/ndw/output/</filename>,
and the documents won’t have the URIs you expect.</para>
</note>
<para>This output URI has nothing to do with where your documents are
ultimately published and the documents themselves won’t contain any references
to it. It simply establishes the root of output. If you’re running your
XSLT processor from the command line, it’s likely that the documents will
be written to that location. If you’re running an XProc pipeline, it simply
controls the URIs that appear on the secondary result port.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>Many aspects of chunking can be easily customized. A few of the most
relevant parameters and templates are:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><parameter>chunk-include</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk-include</secondary></indexterm> and 
<parameter>chunk-exclude</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk-exclude</secondary></indexterm></term>
<listitem>
<para>Taken together, these two parameters determine what elements in your
source document will be considered “chunks” in the output.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><parameter>persistent-toc</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>persistent-toc</secondary></indexterm></term>

<para>If this parameter <glossterm>is true</glossterm>, then a JavaScript
“fly-out” table of contents will be available on every page.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><parameter>chunk-nav</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk-nav</secondary></indexterm></term>

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><code role="template">t:top-nav</code> and
<code role="template">t:bottom-nav</code></term>
<listitem>
<para>These templates control how the top-of-page and bottom-of-page
navigation aids are constructed.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<section xml:id="speaker-notes">
<title>Keyboard navigation and speaker notes</title>

<para>If the <parameter>chunk-nav</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk-nav</secondary></indexterm> parameter <glossterm>is
true</glossterm>, a reference to an additional JavaScript library will
be included in the resulting pages. This library supports keyboard
navigation between the pages. The navigation keys are described in the
<link linkend="p_chunk-nav">parameter reference page</link>.
</para>

<para>There is an additional customization layer
(<filename>xslt/spaeker-notes.xsl</filename>) provided for adding
speaker notes to the pages. This is provided both as an example of a
customization layer and because the author finds it convenient.</para>

<para>If you use the speaker notes customization layer, the any top-level
element in a chunk with the role “<literal>speaker-notes</literal>” will
be suppressed from the default presentation. If you press “<keycap>S</keycap>”
on the page, then you’ll get a “speaker notes” view of the page.</para>

<para>This can be combined with another extension, the use of browser
local storage, to create a simple presentation system. Add this
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">meta</tag> tag to the
<tag>info</tag> element of your document:</para>

<screen role="monochrome border">&lt;meta xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      name="localStorage.key" content="keyname"/&gt;</screen>

<para>That will cause the pages to keep track of their location using the
“<literal>keyname</literal>” property in local storage. This is important
because it enables the following trick:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Configure keyboard navigation, speaker notes, and local storage
in your document.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Arrange for your document to be served up from a web server.
You can do this by running one locally or by putting the documents on a web
server somewhere else.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Open up the main page of your document in a browser.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Open up a second browser <emphasis>window</emphasis> pointing
to the same page. Navigate back and forth between the pages. You should see
that the two windows stay in sync.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Now press “<keycap>S</keycap>” in one of the windows and
navigate around. You should see that the two windows stay in sync and that your
speaker notes are consistently presented in one of the windows.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>I often use this trick when I’m giving presentations. I can project the
slides in one browser window and keep the other browser window on my laptop.
This allows me to see my notes while easily projecting the “real” content.</para>

<section xml:id="profiling">
<title>Effectivity attributes and profiling</title>

<para>When documenting computer hardware and software systems, it’s
very common to have different documentation sets that overlap
signficantly. Documentation for two different models of network
router, for example, might differ only in a few specific details. Or a
user guide aimed at experts might have a lot in common with the new user
guide.</para>

<section>
<title>Effectivity</title>

<para>There are many ways to address this problem, but one of the
simplest is to identify the “effectivity” of different parts of a
document. Effectivity in this context means identifying the parts
of a document that are effective for different audiences.</para>

<para>When a document is formatted, the stylesheets can selectively
include or omit elements based on their configured effectivity. This
“profiled” version of the document is the one that’s explicitly
targeted to the audience specified.</para>

<para>DocBook supports a wide variety of common attributes for this
purpose:</para>

<table>
<title>Common DocBook effectivity attributes</title>
<tgroup cols="2">
<thead>
<row>
<entry>Attribute</entry>
<entry>Nominal effectivity axis</entry>
</row>

<tbody>
<row><entry>arch</entry>
     <entry>The architecture, Intel or AMD</entry></row>
<row><entry>audience</entry>    
     <entry>The audience, operations or development</entry></row>
<row><entry>condition</entry>   
     <entry>Any condition (semantically neutral)</entry></row>
<row><entry>conformance</entry> 
     <entry>The conformance level</entry></row>
<row><entry>os</entry>          
     <entry>The operating system, Windows or Linux</entry></row>
<row><entry>outputformat</entry>
     <entry>The output format, print or online</entry></row>
<row><entry>revision</entry>    
     <entry>The revision, 3.4 or 4.0.</entry></row>
<row><entry>security</entry>    
     <entry>The security, secret or top-secret</entry></row>
<row><entry>userlevel</entry>   
     <entry>The user level, novice or expert</entry></row>
<row><entry>vendor</entry>      
     <entry>The vendor, Acme or Yoyodyne</entry></row>
<row><entry>wordsize</entry>    
     <entry>The word size, 32 or 64 bit</entry></row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</table>

<para>In addition, the stylesheets support profiling on several common attributes
that are not explicitly for effectivity: <tag class="attribute">xml:lang</tag>, <tag class="attribute">revisionflag</tag>,
and <tag class="attribute">role</tag>.</para>

<note>
<para>DocBook places no constraints on the values used for effectivity
and the stylesheets don’t either. You’re free to use “cat” and “dog”
as effectivity values in the <tag class="attribute">wordsize</tag> attribute, if you
wish. The further you deviate from the nominal meaning, the more
important it is to document your system!</para>
</note>

<para>Consider <xref linkend="ex-profile-os"/>.</para>

<section xml:id="dynprofiling">
<title>Dynamic profiling</title>

<para>Dynamic profiling is a feature that allows you to profile the output
of the stylesheets according to the runtime values of stylesheet parameters.
You can, for example, produce different output depending on whether or not
chunking is enabled or JavaScript is being used for annotations.</para>

<para>To enable dynamic profiling, set the <parameter>dynamic-profiles</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>dynamic-profiles</secondary></indexterm>
parameter to “<glossterm baseform="is true">true</glossterm>”.</para>

<para>In the interest of performance, security, and legibility,
dynamic profiles don’t support arbitrary expressions.
You can use a variable name by itself, <code>$flag</code>, which tests
if that variable <glossterm>is true</glossterm>, or you can use a
simple comparison, <code>$var=value</code> which tests if (the string value of)
<code>$var</code> has the value <code>value</code>.
(If <code>$var</code> is a list, it’s an existential
test.) You also can’t use boolean operators or any other fancy expressions.
</para>

<para>If you really need to have a dynamic profile based on some
arbitrary condition, you can do it by making a customization layer
that stores that computation in a variable and then testing that
variable in your dynamic profile.</para>

<sidebar>
<title>Backwards incompatibility</title>
<para>This is slightly backwards
incompatible in that profile values that begin with a dollar sign are
now interpreted differently. This is only true if dynamic profiling is
enabled.</para>
</sidebar>

<para>An element with dynamic profiling will be published if none of
it’s profile expressions evaluate to false. This is slightly different
from the ordinary profiling semantic which publishes the element if
any of it’s values match.</para>

<title>Syntax highlighting</title>

<para>Program listings and other verbatim environments can be “syntax highlighted”,
that is, the significant tokens in the listing can be colored differently (keywords in red,
quoted strings in blue, that sort of thing).</para>

<para>The default syntax highlighter is <biblioref linkend="Pygments"/>, an external
Python program. This has the advantage that the highlighted listing is available to
the stylesheets. The stylesheets can then render line numbers, call outs, and other
features.</para>

<para>But running an external program for every verbatim environment requires
<emphasis>having</emphasis> the external program and also, if there are many verbatim
environments, may slow down the formatting process</para>

<para>An alternative is to use a JavaScript highlighter in the browser such as
<biblioref linkend="highlight.js"/> or <biblioref linkend="Prism"/>. This approach
has no impact on formatting and doesn’t require an external process. However, it means the
<citetitle>xslTNG Stylesheets</citetitle> have no control over the process. Most of the

<para>In many circumstances, the stylesheets can be used “out of the

formatting of title pages or navigational features. In other cases, it
may be to support local extensions to DocBook or simply to change the
markup to support a particular use case.</para>

<para>Three approaches are possible, with increasing degrees of
effort: changing stylesheet parameters, creating your own
customization layer, or making broader changes to the stylesheet’s
implementation.</para>

<para>The subject of broader implementation changes is the subject of
<xref linkend="implementation"/>. In this chapter, we’ll look at the
easier options.</para>

<section xml:id="change-params">
<title>Changing stylesheet parameters</title>

<para>The <citetitle>DocBook xslTNG Stylesheets</citetitle> define a
lot of parameters. They are all described in <xref linkend="params"/>.
If the change you want to make has already been parameterized, you may
be able to achieve your goal simply by setting a parameter at runtime.</para>

<para>For example, if you want to change the formatting of dates and times
in <tag>date</tag> elements, you can simply change the <link xlink:href="p_date-date-format">date and time formatting</link>
parameters. Similarly, if you want to change the numeration style of
ordered lists, you can simply change the <link linkend="p_orderedlist-item-numeration">ordered list item
numeration</link> parameter.</para>

<para>These changes can be accomplished by simply passing the new
values to the processor, on the command line or in a configuration
file, for example. You do not have to write any XSLT to make these
changes.</para>

<para>Parameter values apply to the entire document processed by the
stylesheets. In some cases, you may wish to change the presentation of
just one or small number of elements. This can often be accomplished
with a <link xlink:href="pi_db">db processing instruction</link> in
the source document itself. These customizations can also be
accomplished without writing any XSLT.</para>

<para>If you want to make a change that isn’t supported by a
parameter, or an ad hoc exception that doesn’t have a supporting
processing instruction, you will have to write a customization layer.
(You are invited to submit an issue with your use case if you think it
would be of general interest.)
</para>

<para>You may also find it convenient to write a customization layer
if you want to change several parameters and you find it inconvenient
to pass them all to the processor on every invocation.
</para>
</section>

<section xml:id="layer">
<title>Creating a customization layer</title>

<para>A customization layer is simply an XSLT stylesheet that you
write which extends the DocBook stylesheets. The simplest<footnote><para>Ok,
technically, this stylesheet has a couple of namespace references that aren’t
strictly necessary so it could be a teeny bit simpler, but you’ll need those
declarations (and more!) if you want to do anything useful.</para></footnote> customization
layer is:</para>

<programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet
    xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
    xmlns:db="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    exclude-result-prefixes="db xs"
    version="3.0"&gt;

&lt;!-- This href has to point to your local copy
     of the stylesheets. --&gt;
&lt;xsl:import href="docbook/xslt/docbook.xsl"/&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</programlisting>

<para>This customization doesn’t do anything. But you can, for example, redefine
parameters if you wish:</para>

<programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet
    xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
    xmlns:db="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
    exclude-result-prefixes="db xs"
    version="3.0"&gt;

&lt;xsl:import href="docbook/xslt/docbook.xsl"/&gt;

&lt;xsl:param name="orderedlist-item-numeration"
           select="'1'"/&gt;

&lt;xsl:param name="date-dateTime-format"
           select="'[D01] [MNn,*-3] [Y0001]
                   at [H01]:[m01]'"/&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</programlisting>

<para>This will have the effect of running the DocBook stylesheets with those two
parameters set as specified.</para>

<para>If you want to change the HTML output for an element, you can write a template
for that element in your customization layer. Consider this DocBook document:
</para>

<programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;article xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"
         version="5.1"&gt;
&lt;info&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Sample Document&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2020-07-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;/info&gt;

&lt;para&gt;This is a sample &lt;productname&gt;DocBook&lt;/productname&gt;
document.&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;
</programlisting>

<para>Suppose that you decided you wanted to have the
<tag>productname</tag> element link automatically to the vendor
webpage.</para>

<important>
<para>The <citetitle>DocBook xslTNG Stylesheets</citetitle> process
<emphasis>all</emphasis> DocBook elements in the
<code role="mode">m:docbook</code> mode. This is different from previous XSLT stylesheets for DocBook
which simply used the default mode.</para>
<para>You must either specify a default mode in your customization layer
or remember to specify the mode on match templates and template applications.
If you forget the mode, you’ll get unexpected results!</para>
</important>

<para>One way to do that would be to redefine the template that processes the
<tag>productname</tag> element:</para>

<section xml:id="different">
<title>Creating something completely different</title>

<para>Your input documents go through several pre-processing steps
before they are rendered into HTML. If you want to produce completely
different outputs, the place to start is with root template in the
<code role="mode">m:docbook</code> mode.</para>

<para>Consider, <link xlink:href="https://github.com/docbook/xslTNG/issues/84">for example</link>,
the task of creating a JSON version of the Table of Contents. In principle, you could
write your own stylesheet to do this, but leveraging the
<citetitle>DocBook xslTNG Stylesheets</citetitle> means you can make use of functions like
<function>f:generate-id</function> to create links.</para>

<para>To produce completely different results, override the root template in the
<code role="mode">m:docbook</code> mode:</para>

<programlisting language="xml">&lt;xsl:template match="/" mode="m:docbook"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:document&gt;
    &lt;!-- your processing here --&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:document&gt;

<para>This template <emphasis>must</emphasis> return a document node.</para>

<para>Note that you can mix-and-match your processing with default
processing by processing DocBook elements in the
<code role="mode">m:docbook</code> mode.</para>

<para>Here is a simple example of a stylesheet that produces a JSON version of the
Table of Contents for a DocBook document:</para>

<programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;

<note>
<para>This example is meant as a starting point; it’s not robust as it only handles
a few of the possible elements that might appear in a Table of Contents.</para>
</note>

<para>When processing documents this way, be aware that you are transforming the pre-processed,
normalized versions of your input documents. For example, whether or not you put
<tag>info</tag> wrappers around the titles of your sections, in the pre-processed input,
<tag>title</tag>s <emphasis>always</emphasis> appear inside <tag>info</tag> wrappers.
This normalization greatly simplifies processing in many places.</para>

<parameter>chunk-exclude</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk-exclude</secondary></indexterm> parameters. These parameters are both
strings that must contain an XPath expression.</para>

<para>For each node in the document, the <parameter>chunk-include</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk-include</secondary></indexterm>
parameter is evaluated. If it does not return an empty sequence, the element
is considered a chunking candidate. In this case, the
<parameter>chunk-exclude</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk-exclude</secondary></indexterm> parameter is evaluated. If the exclude
expression <emphasis>does</emphasis> return an empty sequence, then the element identified
becomes a chunk. (If the exclude expression returns a non-empty value, the element
will not become a chunk.)</para>

</section>

<section xml:id="units">
<title>Lengths and units</title>

<para>Lengths appear in the context of images (width and height) and
tables (column widths). Several different units of length are
possible: absolute lengths (e.g., 3in), relative lengths (e.g., 3*),
and percentages (e.g., 25%). In some contexts, these can be combined:
a column width of “3*+0.5in” should have a width equal to 3 times the
relative width plus ½ inch.</para>

<para>In practice, some of the more complicated forms in <biblioref linkend="calstable"/> have no direct mapping to the units available in
HTML and CSS. The stylesheets attempt to specify a mapping that’s
close. Broadly, they take the nominal width of the table
(<parameter>nominal-page-width</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>nominal-page-width</secondary></indexterm>, subtract out the fixed
widths, divide up the remaining widths proportionally among the
relative widths, and compute final widths. The final widths can be
expressed either in absolute terms or as percentages.</para>

<para>In handling the width and height of images, the intrinsic width
and height of the image in pixels are converted into lengths by
dividing by <parameter>pixels-per-inch</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>pixels-per-inch</secondary></indexterm>. Nominal widths are
taken into consideration if necessary.</para>

<note>
<para>Determining the intrinsic size of an image depends on an extension function.
See <xref linkend="extensions"/>. Many bitmap image formats are supported.
The bounding box of EPS images is used, if it’s present. The intrinsic size of
SVG images is not available.</para>

<section xml:id="mediaobject-uris">
<title>Mediaobject URIs</title>

<para>Media object (images, video, audio) URIs are tricky to handle. It’s most
convenient if the URIs in the source documents point to the actual media files.
This allows extensions, like the image properties
<link linkend="extensions">extension function</link>, to access the files.
At the same time, the references generated in the HTML have to point to the
locations where they will be published.</para>

<para>The stylesheets attempt to handle this by using
<parameter>mediaobject-input-base-uri</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>mediaobject-input-base-uri</secondary></indexterm> to locate the files from the
XML sources and <parameter>mediaobject-output-base-uri</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>mediaobject-output-base-uri</secondary></indexterm> to create

<para>If you need a completely different organization of images in the

function.</para>

</section>

<section xml:id="header-templates">
<title>Templates</title>

<para>It’s difficult to make title pages for documents easy to customize. There
is <emphasis>a lot</emphasis> of variation between documents and the styles can
have very precise design constraints. At the end of the day, if you need complete control,
you can define a template that matches the element in the
<code role="mode">m:generate-titlepage</code> mode and generate all of the markup you wish.</para>

<para>The default title page handling attempts to make some declarative customization
possible by using templates. A typical header template looks like this:</para>

<programlisting language="xml">&lt;db:section&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;tmp:apply-templates select="db:title"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;&lt;tmp:content/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/tmp:apply-templates&gt;
    &lt;tmp:apply-templates select="db:subtitle"&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;&lt;tmp:content/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/tmp:apply-templates&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
&lt;/db:section&gt;</programlisting>

<para>Any HTML element in the template will be copied to the output. The semantics
of a “template apply templates” element (<tag>tmp:apply-templates</tag>) is that
it runs the ordinary <tag>xsl:apply-templates</tag> instruction on the elements that
match its select expression. If they result is the empty sequence (e.g, if there is no 
<tag>subtitle</tag>), nothing is output. If there is a result, the content of the
<tag>tmp:apply-templates</tag> element is processed. Anywhere that
<tag>tmp:content</tag> appears, the result of applying templates will be output.</para>

<para>In this example, if the title is “H<subscript>2</subscript>O” and there is no subtitle,
the resulting HTML title page will be:</para>

<programlisting language="xml">&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</programlisting>
</section>

<section xml:id="annotations">
<title>Annotations</title>

<para>The stylesheets fully support annotations, including a number
of presentation styles enabled by JavaScript in the browser. They also
support an extension of the documented semantics of
<tag>annotation</tag>.</para>

<para>Annotations are applied to elements with links. Either the
element must point to its annotations (with an <tag class="attribute">annotations</tag>
attribute) or the annotations must point to the elements they annotate
(with an <tag class="attribute">annotates</tag> attribute). These are documented as
ID/IDREF links but they are not <code>IDREFS</code> attributes
because annotations may be stored separately.</para>

<para>Starting in version 1.5.1, the <citetitle>DocBook xslTNG
Stylesheets</citetitle> support a non-standard extension: if you place
the string <code>xpath:</code> in the <tag class="attribute">annotates</tag> attribute of
an <tag>annotation</tag>, then the rest of the attribute is assumed to contain
an XPath expression that points to the element(s) to which the annotation
applies. (If you want to put IDREF values before the <code>xpath:</code> token,
that’s fine, but you can’t put them after; the expression continues to the end
of the attribute value.)</para>

<para>Suppose, for example, that you wanted to annotate the stylesheet
title in the previous paragraph. The standard mechanisms would require that
you either put an <tag class="attribute">xml:id</tag> attribute on the element or point to the
annotation from the element. With the XPath extension, you can do this:</para>

<annotation xmlns:db="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" annotates="xpath:preceding-sibling::db:para/db:citetitle">
<para>This annotation applies to the stylesheet title. For a discussion
of this annotation, see the following paragraphs.
</para>
</annotation>

<programlisting>&lt;annotation
   annotates="xpath:preceding-sibling::db:para/db:citetitle"
   xmlns:db="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"&gt;
&lt;para&gt;This annotation applies to the stylesheet title.
For a discussion of this annotation, see the
following paragraphs.&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/annotation&gt;</programlisting>

<para>When the XPath expression is evaluated, the <tag>annotation</tag>
element is the context item. Often, this means that you’ll want to start
the expression with <code>id()</code> or <code>/</code>.</para>

<para>The namespace context for the expression is also the <tag>annotation</tag>
element, that’s why I’ve added the DocBook namespace binding for the
<tag class="prefix">db</tag> prefix. In practice, if you’re doing this on
several annotations, you can just put all the namespace bindings on a common
ancestor. All of the bindings <emphasis>in scope</emphasis> on the
<tag>annotation</tag> element are available in the expression.</para>

<para>Caveats:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>There’s no way to have multiple XPath expressions. You can’t put
“<code>xpath:</code>” in there twice. If you want an annotation to apply to
multiple elements, you’ll have to construct a single expression that selects
all the elements, or duplicate the annotation, or use ID/IDREF links.</para>
<para>If this turns out to be a serious limitation in practice, additional
syntax could be added to support multiple expressions, but it doesn’t
<emphasis>seem</emphasis> necessary.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>You can only select elements. There’s no way to select the third word
in a particular paragraph, for example, unless it already has some markup
around it. There’s also no way to select a comment or a processing instruction.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>The placement of the annotation marker (“⌖” by default) can also be
controlled globally and on individual annotations. The
<parameter>annotation-placement</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>annotation-placement</secondary></indexterm> parameter provides global control.
To specify the position for an individual annotation, put the token
“<code>before</code>” or “<code>after</code>” in the <tag class="attribute">role</tag>
attribute on the <tag>annotation</tag>.</para>

</section>
<section xml:id="repostruct">
<title>Repository structure</title>

<para>The most significant parts of the repository hierarchy are:</para>

<screen role="monochrome">src/main/xslt
src/main/xslt/transforms
src/main/xslt/modules</screen>

<para>These are the sources for the stylesheets themselves. The
<filename class="directory">transform</filename> subdirectory contains the preprocessing
stylesheets that are run as separate transforms. The
<filename class="directory">modules</filename> directory doesn’t have any special significance, it
just makes the main entry points easier to find.</para>

<para>You cannot run the XSLT stylesheets directly from the source
location. You must build them first with the
<buildtarget>makeXslt</buildtarget> build target.</para>

<screen role="monochrome">src/main/web
src/main/web/resources/css
src/main/web/resources/js</screen>

<para>These are the CSS and JavaScript files needed for accurate rendering in the
browser or formatter process.</para>

<screen role="monochrome">src/main/locales/locale-10
src/main/locales/locale</screen>

<para>The <filename class="directory">local-10</filename> directory holds copies of the
localization files from the XSLT 1.0 stylesheets. They’re transformed
into the <filename class="directory">locale</filename> versions by the build system. This whole
area is one that needs work.</para>

<screen role="monochrome">src/test/xspec
src/test/generators
src/test/resources/xml
src/test/resources/expected</screen>

<para>These are the testing resources. You cannot run the XSpec tests
directly from <filename class="directory">src/test/xspec</filename>. The build system copies them into
<filename class="directory">build/xspec</filename> along with a few XSpec tests generated
automatically by the stylesheets in <filename class="directory">generators</filename>.
</para>

<para>The library of DocBook documents that are used for testing is
stored in the <filename class="directory">xml</filename> directory. The HTML files in
<filename class="directory">expected</filename> correspond to the expected results. The expected
results aren’t usefully viewed in a browser. Only the
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">body</tag> element and its
decendants are stored in the expected results. This avoids a lot of
noise in the
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">head</tag>.</para>

<screen role="monochrome">src/main/java</screen>

<para>These are the sources for the <link linkend="extensions">extension functions</link>.
</para>

<screen role="monochrome">src/guide
src/website</screen>

<para>These are the sources, resources, and ancillary files for the 
reference guide and the website.</para>

<screen role="monochrome">tools</screen>

<para>The <filename class="directory">tools</filename> directory holds a number of stylesheets and other scripts used
by the build process.</para>

<screen role="monochrome">lib</screen>

<para>The <filename class="directory">lib</filename> directory holds third party jar files. This is also where
you can put your Saxon PE or EE files if you have them.</para>

<screen role="monochrome">build
build/actual
build/xslt</screen>

<para>The build system puts all of its temporary files under <filename class="directory">build</filename>. It’s
always safe to delete the entire directory and start over, though it will require internet
access and it may take a while.</para>

<para>Test files that you format are published to
<filename class="directory">build/actual</filename> and the images, CSS, and JavaScript resources
are copied under there so that everything will look right in the
browser. For security reasons, some JavaScript features may not work
if you are looking at the documents from the filesystem. You can work
around this by pointing a local web server at the build directory.</para>

<para>The built stylesheets are in <filename class="directory">build/xslt</filename>. You can run
them directly from there.</para>
</section>

<section xml:id="buildtasks">
<title>Build tasks</title>

<para>The build system is <biblioref linkend="Gradle"/>. Gradle’s
processing model operates in several phases, this allows an initial
configuration phase to construct build targets (called tasks)
dynamically. The <citetitle>DocBook xslTNG Stylesheets</citetitle>
build script uses this facility quite a bit.</para>

<para>In the discussion that follows, <replaceable>testdoc</replaceable> is the
base name of a test document, that is, one of the example files from the
<filename class="directory">src/test/resources/xml</filename> directory. For example, one of the test documents
is <filename>src/test/resources/xml/article.001.xml</filename>. In the build
targets that would be the “testdoc” <literal>article.001</literal>.
In an analogous way, “testset” is the root name of an XSpec test file in
<filename class="directory">src/test/xspec</filename>.</para>

managed externally. If <parameter>annotation-collection</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>annotation-collection</secondary></indexterm>
points to a collection of annotations, the stylesheets will add them
to the document before it is processed.</para>

<para>To achieve this:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Create a collection of shared annotations and store them somewhere. The
stylesheets will copy only the top-level <tag>annotation</tag> elements
(<literal>/*/annotation</literal>). The
document element doesn’t matter.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Use the <tag class="attribute">annotates</tag> attribute on the annotations to
point at elements in the document you’re transforming.
</para>
<para>Annotations can point in either direction, but you will get
ID/IDREF validation errors if you attempt to point from the document
into the annotation collection because the annotation collection won’t
be present when you validate. If your use case requires pointing in
that direction, you will have better luck with a pipeline that
combines the two documents before validating.</para>

<listitem>

<parameter>annotation-collection</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>annotation-collection</secondary></indexterm> set to the URI of the
document that contains your collection of annotations.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>The stylesheets will apply annotations to the elements
identified. Extra annotations, annotations that don’t point to
elements that actually exist in the document being transformed, will
be ignored.

<title>Description</title>
<para>This parameter is only relevant when chunking is being

list of XPath expressions. When chunking is being applied, for every
element in the document, each expression is evaluated with that
element as the context item. If the effective boolean value of any
expression is true, the element is a candidate for chunking. It will
become a chunk unless <parameter>chunk-exclude</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>chunk-exclude</secondary></indexterm> excludes it

deeply.</para>

<para>The default value for this parameter is:</para>

<para>The <parameter>generate-nested-toc</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>generate-nested-toc</secondary></indexterm> parameter is an
XPath expression. If it evaluates to true when the context item is an

will also appear in the ToC. If the expression returns true for one of those

<refsection>
<title>Description</title>
<para>This parameter specifies the syntax highlighter to use. Most of
the parameters related to syntax highlighting only work if the
<quote><literal>pygments</literal></quote> highlighter is selected.
However, that requires running an external process which might not be
available and which, even if it is available, has an impact on
performance. Using Pygments has the advantage that the stylesheets
have more control over the process and it is available both for online
and paged media formats.
</para>

<para>The alternative to running an external program is to use
JavaScript to highlight the listing in the browser. This is faster at
formatting time, but limits syntax highlighting to those environments where
JavaScript is available.</para>

<para>The following options are supported:</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><literal>pygments</literal></term>
<listitem>
<para>This is the default highlighter.

<para>Trailing blank lines can be introduced into verbatim
environments in a number of ways. Transcluded text files may have
trailing blank lines, for example, and authors often put a newline
before the closing tag of an environment.</para>

If trailing newlines aren’t significant, setting
<parameter>verbatim-trim-trailing-blank-lines</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>verbatim-trim-trailing-blank-lines</secondary></indexterm> will cause
the stylesheets to trim blank (that is, entirely empty) lines from

<para>The stylesheets support XLink extended links. Extended links make
it possible to have one-to-many links. That is, a single link such
as <phrase xlink:type="extended">
         <link xlink:title="DocBook.org" xlink:label="target" xlink:href="https://docbook.org/" xlink:type="locator"/>
         <link xlink:title="DocBook on Wikipedia" xlink:label="target" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook" xlink:type="locator"/>
         <citetitle xlink:label="source" xlink:type="resource">DocBook</citetitle>
         <link xlink:to="target" xlink:from="source" xlink:type="arc"/>
</phrase> may point to more than one target. Two styles are supported:
“<literal>inline</literal>” which renders a link to each target inline after
the originating link, and “<literal>javascript</literal>” which uses
JavaScript<indexterm><primary>JavaScript</primary></indexterm> to create a
popup menu for the links.
</para>
<para>The XLink style for a document applies to the entire document, you cannot
specify inline presentation in some cases and JavaScript presentation in others.
However, if you specify “<literal>document</literal>” as the value for
<parameter>xlink-style</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>xlink-style</secondary></indexterm>, then a
<literal>db</literal><indexterm><primary>db processing instruction</primary>
</indexterm> processing instruction in the document’s top-level <tag>info</tag>
element can be used to control the presentation. Specify the style in the
<literal>xlink-style</literal><indexterm>
<primary>db processing instruction</primary>
<secondary>xlink-style pseudo-attribute</secondary>
</indexterm> pseudo-attribute.</para>
<para>If the <literal>document</literal> style is selected and no
processing instruction specifying a style exists, the

<para>This variable is part of the experimental themes feature. It
enumerates the available themes. Each theme has three parts, a name,
an ID, and (optionally) an indication of whether or not it’s a “dark”
theme.</para>
<para>Themes are implemented in CSS. If the
<parameter>theme-picker</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>theme-picker</secondary></indexterm> is enabled, it will be possible
for the reader to select a theme. The theme names are used for this
purpose.</para>
<para>The ID value is used as a class on the
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">html</tag> element.
Everything else about the theme is implemented in CSS. To add a new theme,
provide a set of CSS rules that apply when the ID class is in effect.</para>
<para>The dark mode setting is only used as a default. If the document
does not specify a <parameter>default-theme</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>default-theme</secondary></indexterm>, if the user
has never selected a theme, if the user has enabled dark mode at the
operating system level, and if the browser makes this fact available,
the first “dark” theme will automatically be selected.</para>

<refsection>
<title>Description</title>
<para>Titles are complicated. They occur all over the place (on books,
on chapters, on sections, on figures, on formal paragraphs, etc.) and
they need to be rendered differently in different contexts. You are
always free to write your own templates to completely customize the
formatting, but the stylesheets provide five declarative properties that
you can select for each title. As long as your formatting requirements
are satisfied by these properties, you don’t have two write custom
templates to do the formatting.</para>
<para>The properties are label, number, number format, inherit, and “label-toc”.
Consider the title in <xref linkend="fig.title-properties"/>.</para>

<figure xml:id="fig.title-properties">
<title>Title Properties</title>
<mediaobject>
<alt>Illustration of title properties in a section title.</alt>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="media/title-properties.png"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<para>This image shows the title “Section 3.4 Changing the print head”
identifying “Section” as the label, “3.4” as the number, and “3.” as
the inherited number.</para>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>For any title context, identified by an XPath expression, you
can set the <literal>label</literal> and <literal>number</literal>
properties to specify whether or not those elements should appear.
If <literal>inherit</literal> is true, the number of the parent element
is included (so the figure might be section 4 in chapter 3, for example).
The <literal>number-format</literal> property determines what style
of numeration is used (arabic, lower- or upper-alpha, or lower- or
upper-roman, for example).</para>

<para>The last property, <literal>label-toc</literal>, determines whether
or not the label appears in the table of contents. This can be used, for example,
to suppress the label “Figure” at the beginning of every figure in a list
of figures.</para>

<para>The stylesheets search this list sequentially and the first match
is used. Observe that <varname>v:user-title-properties</varname><indexterm><primary>variable</primary><secondary>v:user-title-properties</secondary></indexterm> always comes
first; if you want to override the default values, you can put your overrides
in there. You do not have to redefine the entire list.</para>

<refsection>
<title>Description</title>
<para>Cross-references, like <link linkend="v_title-properties">title properties</link>,
are complicated. They can occur almost anywhere and several styles are possible.
</para>

<figure xml:id="fig.xref-properties-1">
<title>Cross-reference Properties (numbered)</title>
<mediaobject>
<alt>Illustration of cross-reference properties in a numbered section reference</alt>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="media/xref-properties-1.png"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<para>This image shows the cross-reference “Section 3.4, Changing the print head”
identifying “Section” as the label, “3.4” as the number, and “, ” as
number separator and “Changing the print head” as the title.</para>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>For documents with numbered sections, a style such as the one shown in
<xref linkend="fig.xref-properties-1"/> is common. Here the label, number, and title 
are sufficient.</para>

<figure xml:id="fig.xref-properties-2">
<title>Cross-reference Properties (contextual)</title>
<mediaobject>
<alt>Illustration of cross-reference properties in an unnumbered section reference</alt>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="media/xref-properties-2.png"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<para>This image shows the title “Section 3.4 Changing the print head”
identifying “Section” as the label, “3.4” as the number, and “3.” as
the inherited number.</para>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>For documents without section numbers, a different approach is required.
In <xref linkend="fig.xref-properties-2"/>, we see how a prefix (which can be literal text
or a key into a localization) precedes the title. If an inherit reference is defined, the
cross reference will include a reference to that element as well. A separator can be placed
between them. If the format for the inherited reference also specifies an inherited reference,
the process will continue.</para>

<para>Several DocBook elements have alternate presentations that can be
specified with global parameters. Many of them can also be set on a per-element
basis with a <tag class="pi">db</tag><indexterm>
<primary>db processing instruction</primary>
</indexterm> processing instruction.
The date format, for example, can be changed in this way as described
in the <function>f:date-format</function> function.</para>
<para>The <function>f:pi</function> function takes a context and the name
of a property. It returns the value specified for that property from all of the
<tag class="pi">db</tag> processing instructions in the
specified context. The three argument version allows you to specify a default
value. It will be returned if there are no values specified for the property
in that context.</para>

<listitem>
<para>is empty, an empty sequence is returned.</para>
</listitem>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>is anything else, the length of the string value of <code>$length</code>

</listitem>
<listitem><para><code>f:spaces("test")</code> is ‘    ’ (four spaces).</para>

</itemizedlist>

<para>This function accepts a sequence to support the empty sequence.
If it’s passed a sequence of more than one item, it treats that as if
the string values of the items had been concatenated together. This can
have slightly surprising consequences as “<code>('a', '3', '0')</code>”
will return a string of three spaces whereas 
“<code>('0', '3', '0')</code>” will return a string of thirty.

<para>This extension function returns a map of metadata properties
about the image, including its <glossterm>intrinsic size</glossterm>:
its width and height in pixels. If the size can be determined, the map
returned will have a “<literal>width</literal>” key whose value is the
width of the image and a “<literal>height</literal>” key whose value
is the height of the image. Both sizes will be integer values.</para>

<para>This function uses the <biblioref linkend="metadata-extractor"/>
library. The map may contain other properties as well.</para>

<para>If the media was successfully parsed with <citetitle>metadata-extractor</citetitle>,
all of the properties identified by the extractor will be returned. Each property
name will be converted to lowercase and spaces will be replaced with hyphens.

in the map with a key of “palette-colour-count”.)</para>

<para>A value that matches the regular expression

properties that have a date/time value.</para></footnote> will be converted to
strings that are valid ISO 8601 date/time values. Any control characters that can’t appear

<para>Maps the element to a particular HTML element. Defaults to
<tag namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">span</tag>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><code>class</code></term>

</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><code>local-name-as-class</code></term>
<listitem>
<para>If this is true, the local name of the DocBook element being processed will
be added to the classes.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><code>content</code></term>
<listitem>
<para>The element content. By default, this is obtained by applying XSLT templates to
the element’s content.</para>

<refclass>template</refclass>

<refsection>
<title>Description</title>
<para>This template formats a personal name according to the specified style.
This template must only be called when the current context item is a
<tag>personname</tag>. The <tag>personname</tag> element can be used
in two different ways, it can just contain the name:</para>

<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;personname&gt;Norman Walsh&lt;/personname&gt;</programlisting>

<para>or it can contain the name with markup:</para>

<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;personname&gt;&lt;givenname&gt;Norman&lt;/givenname&gt;
&lt;surname&gt;Walsh&lt;/surname&gt;&lt;/personname&gt;</programlisting>

<para>How the name is formatted depends on which form of markup is used
and which style is selected. Several styles are supported:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>If the name contains no markup, it is simply formatted as is.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If the style is “<literal>FAMILY-given</literal>”, it is formatted
with <code role="template">t:person-name-family-given</code> and generally produces
the family name in upper case followed by the given name. For example: “WALSH Norman”.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If the style is “<literal>last-first</literal>”, it is formatted
with <code role="template">t:person-name-last-first</code> and generally produces
the family name followed by the given name separated by a comma.
For example: “Walsh, Norman”.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If the style is “<literal>first-last</literal>”, it is formatted
with <code role="template">t:person-name-first-last</code> and generally produces
the given name followed by the family name. For example: “Norman Walsh”.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Any other value raises <errorcode>dbe:INVALID-NAME-STYLE</errorcode>.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<note>
<title>Given names</title>
<para>Historically, DocBook used <tag>firstname</tag> for the given name of a person.
In DocBook 5.1, the <tag>givenname</tag> element was introduced as an
alternative. The stylesheets treat them identically.</para>
</note>

<para>The stylesheets attempt to determine what style to use for each
<tag>personname</tag>:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>First, by looking at that the <tag class="attribute">role</tag> attribute
on that element. If any of styles from the
<varname>v:personal-name-styles</varname><indexterm><primary>variable</primary><secondary>v:personal-name-styles</secondary></indexterm> list appear in the role,
that style will be selected. (If more than one style appears, the
results are undefined.)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If the <tag>personname</tag> doesn’t identify a style, and if it’s a child of
<tag>author</tag>, <tag>editor</tag>, or <tag>othercredit</tag>, the <tag class="attribute">role</tag>
attirbute of its parent is inspected.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If a style still hasn’t been selected and the in-context language
localization file contains a “<literal>personname</literal>” key, the value of that
key is taken as the style.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Failing all those options, the <parameter>default-personal-name-style</parameter><indexterm><primary>param</primary><secondary>default-personal-name-style</secondary></indexterm>
is selected.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Personal names are notoriously complicated (see
<biblioref linkend="falsehoods-about-names"/>). DocBook includes several tags
for identifying parts of names:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><tag>firstname</tag> or <tag>givenname</tag></term>
<listitem>
<para>for a given name,</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><tag>surname</tag></term>
<listitem>
<para>for a family name,</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><tag>lineage</tag></term>
<listitem>
<para>for lineage (such as “Jr” or “III”),</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><tag>honorific</tag></term>
<listitem>
<para>for an honorific title (such as “Dr” or “Ms”), and</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><tag>othername</tag></term>
<listitem>
<para>for everything else.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>In all likelihood, if your document contains a variety of personal names,
you will need to use roles to disambiguate special cases and you will have to
provide alternate or additional templates to format them.</para>

<literallayout class="normal">                GNU Free Documentation License
                   Version 1.1, March 2000

 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.</literallayout>

<glossentry>
<glossterm>hamburger menu</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>The “hamburger menu” or
“<link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button">hamburger
button</link>” is the name for the “☰” icon often used to indicate a menu of choices.
</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry>

<glossentry>
<glossterm>intrinsic size</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>The intrinsic size of an object is it’s actual size, measured in absolute
units, usually pixels. The stylesheets rely on extension functions to obtain
the intrinsic size of objects; if the extension functions aren’t available or the
image format is not recognized, no intrinsic size will be known.</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry>

<glossentry>
<glossterm>object</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>In this guide, the term “object” is used to refer generally to
any image, video, or audio media element. They have a width and a height but no
useful internal structure from the perspective of the stylesheets.
</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry>

<glossentry>
<glossterm>pseudo-attribute</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>Processing instructions (see <biblioref linkend="XML"/>) have no
internal structure. The stylesheets interrogate the
<tag class="pi">db</tag><indexterm><primary>db processing instruction</primary>
</indexterm> processing instruction to determine formatting properties
for a number of different elements.</para>
<para>In order to make it easy to consistently specify different properties,
the value of the processing instruction is parsed as if it contained
attributes. These <emphasis>pseudo-attributes</emphasis> must consist of
a name, followed by “<literal>=</literal>”, followed by a quoted string.</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry>

<glossentry>
<glossterm>is true</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>XPath defines a boolean type, <type>xs:boolean</type>, that is either
true or false. But for the purpose of passing parameters to the stylesheet
at runtime, whether it’s from the command line, from a configuration file, or
through some other means, it’s often more convenient to pass string values.
This saves the user from having to use whatever extra syntactic mechanisms
would be required to identify the type of the variable.</para>
<para>To this end, many “boolean” parameters are actually strings. A string
value <literal>is true</literal> if it consists of one of the strings “true”,
“yes”, or “1”.</para>
</glossdef>
</glossentry>

<glossentry>
<glossterm>Clark name</glossterm>
<glossdef>
<para>A Clark name is a way of unambiguously representing a qualified
name (see <biblioref linkend="XML"/>) as a string. It consists of the
namespace name in curly braces followed immediately by the local name.
For example, the Clark name for the DocBook <tag>para</tag> element
is: “<literal>{http://docbook.org/ns/docbook}para</literal>”.</para>
