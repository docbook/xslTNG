    <glossterm>Cucumber</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>The cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the family
        Cucurbitaceae that bears cylindrical to spherical fruits, which are used as culinary
        vegetables. Considered an annual plant, there are three main types of cucumber—slicing,
        pickling, and seedless—within which several cultivars have been created. The cucumber
        originates in Asia extending from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, China (Yunnan, Guizhou,
        Guangxi), and Northern Thailand, but now grows on most continents, and many different types
        of cucumber are grown commercially and traded on the global market. In North America, the
        term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are
        not closely related.</para>

    <glossterm>Bell Pepper</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>The bell pepper (also known as sweet pepper, pepper, capsicum /ˈkæpsɪkəm/[1] or in some
        places mangoes) is the fruit of plants in the Grossum Group of the species Capsicum annuum.
        Cultivars of the plant produce fruits in different colors, including red, yellow, orange,
        green, white, chocolate, candy cane striped, and purple. Bell peppers are sometimes grouped
        with less pungent chili varieties as "sweet peppers". While they are botanically
        fruits—classified as berries—they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.
        Other varieties of the genus Capsicum are categorized as chili peppers when they are
        cultivated for their pungency, including some varieties of Capsicum annuum. </para>
