<para>This test tests the <parameter>glossary-collection</parameter> machinery when the "internal"
        glossary is not empty, and some glossterms have definitions in the internal and external
        glossaries. The internal entry should cover / overwrite the definition from the external
        glossary.</para>
    <para>So we expect a glossary with three entries, mixed from the internal and the external
        glossaries. The <code>glossdef</code> for Apple should be the internal one, although there
        is also an entry in the external glossary.</para>

                <para>In early autumn the apple orchards come alive with people and sounds. The
                    farmers are picking, peeling, and processing apples into everything from apple
                    pies to apple sauce. Families swarm the apple trees with their baskets looking
                    for the best Honeycrisp and Macintosh. The sound of children playing is blended
                    with the occasional barking dog, or the low rumble of the old Ferguson Orchard
                    tractor pulling a wagon up and down the rows. </para>

        <glossdef>
                <para>Sanguinaria canadensis, bloodroot, is a perennial, herbaceous flowering plant
                    native to eastern North America. It is the only species in the genus
                    Sanguinaria, included in the poppy family Papaveraceae, and is most closely
                    related to Eomecon of eastern Asia.</para>
                <para>It is sometimes known as Canada puccoon, bloodwort, redroot, red puccoon, and
                    black paste. Plants are variable in leaf and flower shape, and have been
                    separated as a different subspecies due to these variable shapes, indicating a
                    highly variable species. </para>
