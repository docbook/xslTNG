    <para>This test is essentially the same as <literal>glossary.007</literal>. The difference is,
        that we have two external glossaries, both referenced by the following processing
        instruction:</para>
    <programlisting>&lt;?db glossary-collection='../../../src/test/resources/glosscollection.xml 
                          ../../../src/test/resources/glosscollection2.xml' ?>
    </programlisting>
    <para>It checks the <parameter>glossary-collection</parameter> machinery when the "internal"
        glossary is not empty, and some glossterms have definitions in the internal and external
        glossaries. The internal entry has priority and should therefore cover / overwrite the
        definition from the external glossary.</para>
    <para>We expect a glossary with three entries, mixed from the internal and the external
        glossaries. <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><glossterm>Apple</glossterm> should reference the internal, poetic
                    definition.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><glossterm>Pear</glossterm> references the external definition from
                        <filename>glosscollection</filename>;</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><glossterm>Cucumber</glossterm> references the external definition from
                        <filename>glosscollection2</filename>.</para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>We do <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> expect an entry for
            <emphasis>Quince</emphasis> or <emphasis>Bloodroot</emphasis> in the results document
        glossary, although there is an entry in the internal glossary of the input document, because
        there is no <emphasis>glossterm</emphasis> or <emphasis>firstterm</emphasis> that references
        it.</para>

                <para>The quince (/ˈkwɪns/; Cydonia oblonga) is the sole member of the genus Cydonia
                    in the Malinae subtribe (which also contains apples and pears, among other
                    fruits) of the Rosaceae family. It is a deciduous tree that bears hard, aromatic
                    bright golden-yellow pome fruit, similar in appearance to a pear. Ripe quince
                    fruits are hard, tart, and astringent. They are eaten raw or processed into
                    marmalade, jam, paste (known as quince cheese) or alcoholic beverages. </para>

                <para>In early autumn the apple orchards come alive with people and sounds. The
                    farmers are picking, peeling, and processing apples into everything from apple
                    pies to apple sauce. Families swarm the apple trees with their baskets looking
                    for the best Honeycrisp and Macintosh. The sound of children playing is blended
                    with the occasional barking dog, or the low rumble of the old Ferguson Orchard
                    tractor pulling a wagon up and down the rows. </para>

            <glossdef>
                <para>Sanguinaria canadensis, bloodroot, is a perennial, herbaceous flowering plant
                    native to eastern North America. It is the only species in the genus
                    Sanguinaria, included in the poppy family Papaveraceae, and is most closely
                    related to Eomecon of eastern Asia.</para>
                <para>It is sometimes known as Canada puccoon, bloodwort, redroot, red puccoon, and
                    black paste. Plants are variable in leaf and flower shape, and have been
                    separated as a different subspecies due to these variable shapes, indicating a
                    highly variable species. </para>
