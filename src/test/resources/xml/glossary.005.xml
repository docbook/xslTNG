                <para>Sanguinaria canadensis, bloodroot, is a perennial, herbaceous flowering plant
                    native to eastern North America. It is the only species in the genus
                    Sanguinaria, included in the poppy family Papaveraceae, and is most closely
                    related to Eomecon of eastern Asia.</para>
                <para>It is sometimes known as Canada puccoon, bloodwort, redroot, red puccoon, and
                    black paste. Plants are variable in leaf and flower shape, and have been
                    separated as a different subspecies due to these variable shapes, indicating a
                    highly variable species. </para>
