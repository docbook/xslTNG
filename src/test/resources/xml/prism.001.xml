<title>Unit test: prism.001</title>

<para>This is a test for syntax highlighting with
<link xlink:href="https://prismjs.com/">prism</link>.</para>

<para>Program listings are highlighted and numbered by default:</para>

<programlisting language="python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""This is yet another link checker. Was it better to write my own
than find an existing cross-platform version? Maybe not, but it
appeared to be easier."""

import re
import os
import sys
import json
import glob
import click
try:
    import html5_parser
    import lxml.etree
    from saxonche import PySaxonProcessor
    importOk = True
except ImportError:
    importOk = False</programlisting>

<para>But numbering can be turned off:</para>

<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""This is yet another link checker. Was it better to write my own
than find an existing cross-platform version? Maybe not, but it
appeared to be easier."""

import re
import os
import sys
import json
import glob
import click
try:
    import html5_parser
    import lxml.etree
    from saxonche import PySaxonProcessor
    importOk = True
except ImportError:
    importOk = False</programlisting>

<para>And so can highlighting. The most reliable way to disable highlighting
is to remove the <tag class="attribute">language</tag> attribute from the listing.
