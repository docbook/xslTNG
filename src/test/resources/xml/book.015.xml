    <title>Purpose of this Book</title>
    <para>This book contains a table with two wide columns. 
      The table won't fit on a regular, portrait-oriented page which is about 160 or 170mm wide (assuming A$ paper size).
      This is why it is printed in landscape orientation in PDF output.
      But as always, there are different ways to achieve this goal.</para>
    <para>Only this chapter should be printed in landscape orientation</para>
    <informaltable>
      <tgroup cols="2">
        <colspec colwidth="120mm"/>
        <colspec colwidth="80mm"/>
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry><para>This is a very wide column (120mm)</para></entry>
            <entry><para>The second column is also wide (80mm)</para></entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
      <caption>
        <para>The caption for ths table should be printed in the same orientation as the table itself.</para>
      </caption>
    </informaltable>
    <para>This is a regular <tag>para</tag> below the very wide table.
      It has nothing to say, but will show the orientation within the firts chapter of this book</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Second Chapter</title>
    <para>The second chapter will end this book, which is very short indeed. It does not tell us anything about the outside world,
    it's only purpuse is to show the effect of PDF pages in landscape orientation.</para>
