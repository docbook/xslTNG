    domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most
    widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in
    Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still
    found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia
    and Europe and were brought to North America by European
    colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in
    many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian
    tradition.</p></dd><dt id="R_g1_ge3" class="glossentry"><span class="glossterm">Bloodroot</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Sanguinaria canadensis, bloodroot, is a perennial,
      herbaceous flowering plant native to eastern North America. It
      is the only species in the genus Sanguinaria, included in the
      poppy family Papaveraceae, and is most closely related to
      Eomecon of eastern Asia.</p><p>It is sometimes known as Canada puccoon, bloodwort,
      redroot, red puccoon, and black paste. Plants are variable in
      leaf and flower shape, and have been separated as a different
      subspecies due to these variable shapes, indicating a highly
      variable species. </p></dd><dt id="pear" class="glossentry"><span class="glossterm">Pear</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>The pear tree and shrub are a species of genus
    Pyrus, in the family Rosaceae, bearing the pomaceous
    fruit of the same name. Several species of pear are valued for
    their edible fruit and juices while others are cultivated as
    trees.</p></dd></dl></div></article></main><nav class="bottom"></nav></body></html>
