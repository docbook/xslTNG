    <para>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus
    domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most
    widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in
    Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still
    found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia
    and Europe and were brought to North America by European
    colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in
    many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian
    tradition.</para>
