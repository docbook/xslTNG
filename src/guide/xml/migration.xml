    <title>Migration from XSLT 1.0 to XSLT 3.0</title>
  </info>

<!--
This is the migration chapter for issue #212

Some ideas to cover:

* Benefits of moving to the new stylesheets (that's probably mostly covered in this project already)
* Target groups (probably developers that already wrote customization layers?)
* Requirements:
  * Skills needed (certainly some XSLT/XPath 3.0 would be useful)
  * Software (perhaps Saxon9-12. Other XSLT 3.0 processors aren't available at the moment, right?)
  * System (the necessary dependencies, Docker images, or other requirements etc.)
* Migration considerations
* Tips and recommendations
* Best practices
* Traps or things to avoid (for example, how to migrate extension elements/functions from other XSLT
  processors, like exsl:node-set)
* Testing
  The xslTNG stylesheets contains test cases which is really great! How can we use this for a migration project?
* Costs
  Not so from a financial aspect, but more about:
  * Speed (is it slower/faster than the DocBook XSLT 1.0 stylesheets with xsltproc? By what factor? What can we do to speed up things?)
  * Time (how much effort is it to move an existing code base? I know, that's hard to answer, but maybe there are some experiences?)
  * Complete rewrite? (when it is useful to just throw away the existing code base and start from scratch? Any experience?)
